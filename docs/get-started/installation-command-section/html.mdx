Use the Storybook CLI to install it in a single command. Run this inside your _existing project’s_ root directory:

```shell
# Add Storybook:
npx storybook init --type html
```

If you run into issues with the installation, check the [Troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) below for guidance on how to solve it.
